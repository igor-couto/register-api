This is the Register API. What does it do? Well, it does registrations. Saves information in the database.

This project serves so that I can practice some concepts, without thinking too much about what I'm going to develop. By itself, it's not useful at all.
However, here I implement some important concepts:

- .NET 6.0
- Azure deployment and configuration
- CI/CD with github workflows and actions
- Authentication
- JWT Authorization with claims
- Refresh Token
- Password storage with salt and slow hashing
- Docker
- Migrations
- Conventional commits
- Semantic versioning
- And many other things that I can imagine and be willing to do
